We will import all of our scss from the components as partials into "style.scss" to compile into nicely into "style.css"

We will also have "variables.scss" and third party scss in the vendor file folder.

I would like to pull all of these into the assets folder location for cleanliness and to keep our scss + css all in on place for easy navigation in the case of naming conflicts.
